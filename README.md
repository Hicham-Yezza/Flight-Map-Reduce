The map-reduce paradigm offers a simple yet powerful approach for leveraging distributed and parallel processing capabilities to increase computational efficiency. 

In this project a software prototype is proposed for implementing a map-reduce-like programme for identifying passengers with the most flights from a provided list. 

The design successfully addressed the task through the use of a mapper-combiner setup and the deployment of multithreading. 

The programme is comprised of two main files: 

- FlightCounterMain.py and 
- FlightCounterCommon.py
